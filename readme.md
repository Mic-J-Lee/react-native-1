Used create-react-native-app, and Expo Audio to create a less than MVP for an audio flashcard language learning app.  

Audio will only play (activated by button press) 14 times before ceasing to work, mysteriously...

I will abandon this repo for now, and build the same app without bootstrapping with create-react-native-app so that I can use react-native-sound instead of Expo Audio
